<h6>The site</h6>
<p><a style="color: #008eff;" href="https://cg3d.org">CG 3D</a> is the place to share 3D Models by <a style="color: #008eff;" href="https://pretendedstudio.com">Pretended Studio</a> under <a style="color: #008eff;" href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0">Public Domain Mark</a> and <a style="color: #008eff;" href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0">Creative Commons Zero</a> License.</p>
<p>The 3D Models that created are currently from the minimum system requirements and from the basic shapes (low poly) without being encrypted, so you can choose <a style="color: #008eff;" href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/">Creative Commons</a> by you and use it however. If you are expect 3D Models that includes a lot of assets, maybe will make it a few parts when itâ€™s published. These 3D Models are shared with priority to be able to see the results of the sample rendering with minimum system requirements, although I can create more detailed 3D models and then use render farm to see the results.</p>
